# Protein GAN

This repository contains a DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) for predicting protein structure.

## Description

This is a machine learning project by me (krthkmgndm) that uses a DCGAN to generate protein structures. I have set up some interactive Jupyter notebooks in this notebooks folder to walk you through how this repository works. 

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To train the model, run:

```bash
python train.py
```

To generate protein structures, run:

```bash
python generate.py
```

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw protein data files.
- `models/`: Contains model definitions.
- `scripts/`: Contains scripts for data preprocessing and analysis.
- `train.py`: Script to train the DCGAN model.
- `generate.py`: Script to generate protein structures using the trained model.
